//What is a class?
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
class  A 
{
    int x;
    void getData()
    {
        cout<<"This is class";
    }
};

int main()
{
    x=10;
    getData();
    return 0;
}
OUTPUT:
The output of the above program is Compilation error because
1) In CPP class, by default the access specifier is private.
2) We cannot access the private members and private methods directly in main.

// Accessibility in a class
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
class  A 
{
    public:
    int x;
    void getData()
    {
        cout<<"This is class";
    }
};

int main()
{
    x=10;
    getData();
    return 0;
}
OUTPUT:
The output of this program is also compilation error because, 
1) Even though the class variables and methods are declared in the public scope,
we cannot access it directly without creating an object for the class in main function.
