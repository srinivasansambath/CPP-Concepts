//What is a class?
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
class  A 
{
    int x;
    void getData()
    {
        cout<<"This is class";
    }
};

int main()
{
    x=10;
    getData();
    return 0;
}
OUTPUT:
The output of the above program is Compilation error because
1) In CPP class, by default the access specifier is private.
2) We cannot access the private members and private methods directly in main.
